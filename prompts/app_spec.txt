Build a modern task management web application with the following features:

Core Functionality:
- Create, read, update, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Filter tasks by status (all, active, completed)
- Search tasks by title or description
- Priority levels (high, medium, low) with color coding
- Due dates with calendar picker
- Task categories/tags

User Interface:
- Clean, modern design with responsive layout
- Dark mode toggle
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Toast notifications for actions

Technical Requirements:
- Use React with TypeScript for the frontend
- Use Vite as the build tool
- State management with React Context or Zustand
- LocalStorage for data persistence
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Comprehensive error handling
- Accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

The application should be production-ready with proper documentation.
